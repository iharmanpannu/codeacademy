// GET and POST requests can be created a variety of ways.

// We can asynchronously request data from APIs using AJAX. fetch() and async/await are new technologies developed in ES6 and ES7 respectively.

// Promises are a new type of JavaScript object that represent data that will eventually be returned from a request.

// fetch() is a web API that can be used to create requests. fetch() will return Promises.

// We can chain .then() methods to handle Promises returned by fetch.

// The .json() method converts a returned Promise to a JSON object.

// async is a keyword that is used to create functions that will return Promises.

// await is a keyword that is used to tell a program to continue moving through the message queue while a Promise resolves.

// await can only be used within functions declared with async.
